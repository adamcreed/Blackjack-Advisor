# <Blackjack-Advisor>
> Advises blackjack players of optimal play based on their dealt cards and the dealer's face-up card.

## Usage

Cards should be entered by their numeric or single-letter face value. The program will prompt for the player's cards first, with or without a space between them, then the dealer's face-up card. The program will then suggest 'hit', 'stand', 'split', 'double if possible, otherwise hit', or 'double if possible, otherwise stand' as appropriate.
